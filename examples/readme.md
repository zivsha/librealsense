# Sample Code for Intel® RealSense™ cameras
**Code Examples to start prototyping quickly:** These simple examples demonstrate how to easily use the SDK to include code snippets that access the camera into your applications.  

For mode advanced usages please review the list of [Tools](../tools) we provide. 

For a detailed explanations and API documentation see our [Documentation](../doc) section 
 
## List of Samples:

1. [Capture](./capture) - Show how to syncronize and render multiple streams: left & right imagers, depth and RGB streams. 
2. [Save To Disk](./save-to-disk) - Demonstrate how to render and save video streams on headless systems without graphical user interface (GUI). 
3. [Multicam](./multicam) - Present multiple cameras depth streams simultaneously, in separate windows.
4. [Pointcloud](./pointcloud) - Showcase Projection API while generating and rendering 3D pointcloud. 
5. [Streams Alignment](./align) - Show a simple method for dynamic background removal from video. 
6. [Sensor Control](./sensor-control) -- A tutorial for using the `rs2::sensor` API
7. Measure - Lets the user measure the dimentions of 3D objects in a picture.
